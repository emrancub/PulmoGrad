# PulmoGrad: Reproducible ML Workflow for COPD Severity (Everything is empty until a decision)

**What it is.** Leakage-safe, imbalance-aware COPD severity pipeline (ADASYN in-train, nested CV with Hyperopt, RF/XGB/LGBM/CatBoost, soft-voting hybrid, ROC/SHAP, full artifacts).

## Quick start
```bash
# CPU or GPU; prefer a clean venv/conda env

# Everything is empty until a decision
